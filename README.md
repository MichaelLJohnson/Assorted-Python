# Assorted Python

## Purpose
So I am probably one of the most forgetful people ever. Also, passing off the "helpful" things you learned in a format you would've liked just might be helpful. That is what this is. A thing to have a more or less guided reference in somewhat plain English, along with examples (that, like any code, *hopefully* works) to help someone learn or relearn some Python. Neat.
